# General ML Projects

This repository is more of a general purpose place for me to store any general
machine learning projects that I've done over time. 


## Prerequisites
If using Python, by default the following packages should be installed:

You can either have the packages installed globally:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib notebook torch torchvision torchaudio
```

Alternatively you can do this in virtual environment:
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib notebook torch torchvision torchaudio
```

This repository will assume it's installed globally, but we also include a
`requirements.txt` to be precise of which versions we expect.

# Projects

The first few projects will follow along Andrej Karpathy's

playlist and then will continue from there.
